Assignment #1 Applied Statistics, Spring 2019 This is due before the beginning of live session on the due date. Please submit as word document or pdf. Read the article Tennessee’s Class Size Study: Findings, Implications, Misconceptions (Finn & Achilles, 1999). Discuss the population and sample in this study. Is the sample representative of the population? Population: K-3 students and the sample: the +6000, 329 classrooms, and 46 districts in TN who participated in this study. The sample is not representative due to the restraints the study placed on size restrictions; therefore, this presents a concern as to the generalizability of the study. At the time of the study the ration of black:white students were said to mirror the USA however not Hispanic and Asian students. Identify the independent and dependent variables in the waves of the experiment that covered participants in grades K-3. (hint: additional measures were used after the experiment ended, you do not need to include those). The DV would be the mean math and reading score on the SAT for each grade. The IV is class size Classify the dependent variable in the experiment as either continuous or discrete. Continuous Classify the independent variable in the experiment as either continuous or discrete. Discrete as the size is a whole number and not a decimal ppoint on a continuum. Consider the following frequency distribution: Score f 7 18 18/129= .14 14% 6 77 77/129= .6 60% 5 20 20/129= .15 15% 4 7 7/129= .05 5% 3 3 3/129= .02 2% 2 1 1/129= .01 1% 1 3 3/129= .02 2% What was the sample size? N=129 What percent of participants had a score of 4? 5.42% What is the percentile rank for a score of 5? 15% What is the score corresponding to the 80th percentile? 6 Answer the following questions 3-7 using R (this has to be done in R and not by hand unless you want to check your answers). Copy and paste code and output into document. Make sure questions are clearly labeled. Do not write answers as comments in R. Define objects for values 10 and 2. Use the objects to compute the following: 10+2 ?10?^2 √(10-2) x<-10 > y<-2 > >x+y > x+y [1] 12 > x(2) Error in x(2) : could not find function "x" > sqrt(x) [1] 3.162278 > sqrt(x-y) [1] 2.828427 The following sample data are scores for 18 individuals on a 1 - 7 Likert-scale: 1, 7, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 1, 6, 4, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 6, 4, 3 Enter the data into R as a vector. Print the vector. Create an ungrouped frequency distribution. Add percentage, cumulative frequency and cumulative percent. The following sample data are scores for 18 individuals: 84, 76, 88, 86, 71, 85, 63, 76, 80, 79, 83, 66, 46, 96, 82, 73, 81, 92 Enter the data into R as a vector. Print the vector. Create a grouped frequency distribution using 5 bins. Add percentage, cumulative frequency and cumulative percent. Create a histogram (number of bins do not need to match part b) Describe the shape of the distribution using terminology learned in class. Create a data frame using the two vectors created in problems (2) and (3). Print the data frame. Consider two variables from a sample of 15 professors: the number of years since obtaining Ph.D. (time) and number of publications (pubs). Import the phd.txt dataset into R and print out the dataset. Calculate and report the mean, median and standard deviation for each variable. Interpret each value from the previous question.
